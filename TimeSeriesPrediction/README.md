# Time Series Forecast
Predicting future values based on the analysis of past data points in a chronological sequence. 
It is commonly used to anticipate trends, patterns, or behaviors in time-ordered datasets

## Examples

**Linear Regression**: Basic idea of neuronal networks, additionally to a traditionally linear regression model approach for comparison.
All models are used to find the linear relationship between revenue of a ice cream salar and the temperature(data is of course not real world)

**Univariant Time Series Forecast**: Predictor for airline passenger forecast, simple neuronal network for basic understanding timeseries forecasting. 

**NetworkTypeComparison**: 3 different Predictors for Google Stock Data, based on RNN, LSTM an GRU architecture. Shows the different results of these network types

**Multivariant Time Series Forecast** Predictor for Beijing weather data. Model uses multiple tim series to predict output value.
