# README

This repo is a summary for deep learning / neuronal network practice. 
The different examples are implemented in pytorch, tensorflow keras 
and also a "from scratch" implementation according to the "neuronal networks from scratch" series.

### Linear Regression
basic idea of neuronal networks in keras and pytorch, additionally to a traditionally linear regression model approach for comparison.
All models are used to find the linear relationship between revenue of a ice cream salar and the temperature( data is of course not real world)
All scripts produces images of data points + line of several predictions of the model + run time for easy comparison


### Digit Classification
Classifier for the mnist dataset of handwritten digit. MNIST is implementent in original data files to learn on data preparation.
Digit classification is done in keras and pytorch with and without the use of CNNs.
